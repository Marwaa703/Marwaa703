## 🚀 About Me  

🔧 **Builder at Heart**  
I thrive on creating applications that blend robust functionality with an exceptional user experience. Whether it's designing sticky glass-effect navbars, animating delivery truck loaders, or crafting secure server-side logic, I aim for perfection in every detail.  

🎮 **Game Enthusiast & Creator**  
Interactive experiences spark my creativity. From developing games like **It Takes Four** to ensuring smooth animations for gameplay, I enjoy making ideas come to life in engaging ways. Bonus: I’m all about the strategy and fun!  

🎨 **Aesthetic Meets Functional**  
For me, design is more than just looks—it’s about how it feels. Using tools like Material-UI and Ant Design, I craft sleek, responsive interfaces, like circular card animations or dynamic menus, that are both eye-catching and intuitive.  

🔐 **Security & Problem-Solving**  
With expertise in JWT-based authentication and role-based access, I ensure applications are secure and cater to specific user needs—whether it’s for customers, admins, or owners.
